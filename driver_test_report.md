# Ommi Driver Validation Test Report

## Summary
This report summarizes the results of running the Ommi validation test suite with the SQLite driver.
Out of 42 tests run, 17 passed (40.5%), 24 failed (57.1%), and 1 was skipped (2.4%).

## Issue Categories

### 1. Model Definition Issues
The test suite has been refactored to use only dataclasses instead of attrs or pydantic models. The previous model definition issues with non-default arguments following default arguments have been fixed by ensuring proper field ordering in the dataclasses.

The validation suite no longer contains:
- Attrs models
- Pydantic models 
- Models with incorrect field ordering

However, some relationship tests are still failing with:
```
DBStatusNoResultException: DBResult does not wrap a result
```
This suggests issues with the lazy loading implementation in the SQLite driver.

### 2. Query API Issues
Several tests are failing due to API issues in the query objects:

- **Missing query methods**:
  - `'ASTReferenceNode' object has no attribute 'contains'`
  - `'ASTReferenceNode' object has no attribute 'in_'`
  - `TypeError: 'ASTReferenceNode' object is not callable`
  - `TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~: 'ASTReferenceNode'`

- **Subscripting coroutines**:
  - `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable` in multiple tests

### 3. SQLite-specific Limitations

- **SQL Syntax Errors**:
  - `sqlite3.OperationalError: near "Order": syntax error` - "Order" is a reserved keyword in SQL
  - `sqlite3.OperationalError: near "index": syntax error`

- **Transaction Limitations**:
  - `sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot start a transaction within a transaction` - SQLite doesn't support nested transactions

- **Type Validation Issues**:
  - `TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class`

### 4. Transaction Implementation Issues

- **Isolation Issues**:
  - `AssertionError: Outside transaction should only see initial model` - Transaction isolation not working correctly

## Updated Recommendations

1. **Lazy Loading Implementation**:
   - Fix the implementation of lazy loading in the SQLite driver
   - Ensure the `LazyLoadTheRelated` and `LazyLoadEveryRelated` functionality works correctly
   - Address the `DBStatusNoResultException` errors in the relationship tests

2. **Query API**:
   - Implement missing query methods on ASTReferenceNode
   - Fix handling of coroutine returns from async methods

3. **SQLite Driver Improvements**:
   - Add support for reserved keywords in schema names
   - Implement nested transaction emulation (savepoints)
   - Fix transaction isolation

4. **Test Refinements**:
   - Modify tests to account for database-specific limitations
   - Add driver-specific parameterization for tests that require certain features

## Passing Tests (17)

The following tests are working correctly with the SQLite driver:
- Basic CRUD operations (insert, fetch, update, delete)
- Simple schema management operations
- Basic transaction commits and rollbacks
- Data validation
- Basic query conditions

## Conclusion

After refactoring the validation test suite to only use dataclasses, we've fixed the Python language constraint issues related to model definitions. However, the underlying functionality issues with lazy loading relationships, query capabilities, and transaction handling still need to be addressed.

The SQLite driver appears to be missing or having issues with important ORM features like relationship loading and complex queries. These issues would similarly affect the MongoDB and PostgreSQL drivers, as they all need to implement the same interface.

A focused effort on fixing the lazy loading implementation and query API would significantly improve compatibility across all supported databases.
