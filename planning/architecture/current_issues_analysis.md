# Current Architecture Issues Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the specific architectural issues currently affecting Ommi, based on the test report showing 40.5% test success rate and identified system problems.

## Critical Architecture Issues

### 1. Result System Inconsistencies

#### Problem Description
The `DBStatusNoResultException: DBResult does not wrap a result` error indicates fundamental issues with how database operation results are created, wrapped, and propagated through the system.

#### Root Cause Analysis
```python
# Current problematic pattern (inferred from errors)
async def some_operation():
    result = await database_call()
    # Missing result wrapping step
    return result  # Raw result, not wrapped in DBResult

# Expected pattern
async def some_operation():
    try:
        result = await database_call()
        return DatabaseResult.Success(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return DatabaseResult.Failure(e)
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Lazy Loading Broken:** Relationship fields cannot load related data
- **Error Handling Inconsistent:** Some operations return unwrapped results
- **API Reliability:** Users cannot depend on consistent result types

#### Affected Components
- `ommi/database/results.py` - Result wrapper implementation
- `ommi/ext/drivers/*/` - All driver implementations
- `ommi/models/query_fields.py` - Lazy loading fields

#### Fix Strategy
1. **Audit Result Creation:** Find all places where database results are created
2. **Standardize Wrapping:** Ensure all operations return wrapped results
3. **Type Safety:** Add type hints to catch unwrapped results at development time
4. **Testing:** Add comprehensive result wrapper tests

### 2. Incomplete Query AST Implementation

#### Problem Description
The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) system is missing critical operators and methods, limiting query capabilities and causing runtime errors.

#### Missing Components
```python
# Missing methods in ASTReferenceNode
class ASTReferenceNode:
    # These methods are missing or broken:
    def contains(self, value):  # AttributeError: 'ASTReferenceNode' object has no attribute 'contains'
        pass
    
    def in_(self, values):      # AttributeError: 'ASTReferenceNode' object has no attribute 'in_'
        pass
    
    def __call__(self, *args):  # TypeError: 'ASTReferenceNode' object is not callable
        pass
    
    def __invert__(self):       # TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~: 'ASTReferenceNode'
        pass
```

#### Coroutine Handling Issues
```python
# Current problematic pattern
async def query_operation():
    result = some_async_operation()
    # TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable
    return result[0]  # Trying to subscript before awaiting

# Should be:
async def query_operation():
    result = await some_async_operation()
    return result[0]  # Now result is awaited and subscriptable
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Limited Query Capabilities:** Users cannot express complex queries
- **Runtime Errors:** Type errors when using missing operators
- **Inconsistent API:** Some operators work, others don't

#### Fix Strategy
1. **Complete Operator Implementation:** Add all missing methods to AST nodes
2. **Async/Await Audit:** Ensure proper coroutine handling throughout
3. **Cross-Driver Testing:** Verify operators work across all drivers
4. **Documentation Update:** Document all available query operators

### 3. Driver Implementation Gaps

#### Problem Description
Database drivers have inconsistent feature implementation, leading to unpredictable behavior across different databases.

#### SQLite-Specific Issues

**Reserved Keyword Problems:**
```sql
-- Current broken output
CREATE TABLE Order (...)  -- "Order" is SQL reserved keyword
-- sqlite3.OperationalError: near "Order": syntax error

-- Should generate:
CREATE TABLE "Order" (...)  -- Properly quoted
```

**Transaction Limitations:**
```python
# Current broken pattern
async with db.transaction():
    async with db.transaction():  # Nested transaction
        # sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot start a transaction within a transaction
        pass
```

**Type Validation Issues:**
```python
# Current broken validation
def validate_type(field_type):
    if issubclass(field_type, str):  # TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class
        return True
```

#### Impact Assessment
- **Portability Broken:** Code doesn't work consistently across databases
- **SQLite Unreliable:** Primary testing database has multiple issues
- **Production Risk:** Subtle differences could cause production failures

#### Fix Strategy
1. **Reserved Keyword Handling:** Implement proper SQL identifier quoting
2. **Nested Transaction Emulation:** Use savepoints for SQLite
3. **Type System Hardening:** Add defensive type checking
4. **Driver Compliance Testing:** Ensure all drivers pass identical test suite

### 4. Transaction Isolation Problems

#### Problem Description
Transaction isolation is not working correctly, allowing uncommitted changes to be visible outside transaction boundaries.

#### Current Behavior (Broken)
```python
async with db.transaction():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    await db.add(user)
    
    # This should NOT see the uncommitted user
    # But currently it does due to isolation failure
    outside_users = await other_connection.find(User.name == "Alice").fetch.all()
    assert len(outside_users) == 0  # FAILS - sees uncommitted data
```

#### Expected Behavior
```python
async with db.transaction():
    user = User(name="Alice")
    await db.add(user)
    
    # Outside connections should not see uncommitted changes
    outside_users = await other_connection.find(User.name == "Alice").fetch.all()
    assert len(outside_users) == 0  # Should PASS
    
# Only after commit should it be visible
outside_users = await other_connection.find(User.name == "Alice").fetch.all()
assert len(outside_users) == 1  # Now it should be visible
```

#### Root Causes
- **Connection Sharing:** Transactions may be sharing connections incorrectly
- **Isolation Level:** Database isolation level not properly configured
- **Connection Pooling:** Pool may be reusing connections across transactions

## Architectural Debt

### 1. Error Handling Inconsistency

#### Problem
Different components handle errors in different ways, making the system unpredictable.

```python
# Driver A pattern
try:
    result = await operation()
    return DatabaseResult.Success(result)
except Exception as e:
    return DatabaseResult.Failure(e)

# Driver B pattern (broken)
result = await operation()  # May raise exception
return result  # May not be wrapped

# Driver C pattern (inconsistent)
result = await operation()
if result is None:
    return DatabaseResult.Failure("No result")
return result  # Unwrapped success
```

#### Solution
Standardize error handling patterns across all components.

### 2. Type System Gaps

#### Problem
The type system doesn't properly handle all Python type scenarios.

```python
# Current issues
def process_field_type(field_type):
    # Fails for generic types like List[str], Optional[int]
    if issubclass(field_type, str):  # TypeError
        return "string"
```

#### Solution
Implement robust type handling for modern Python type annotations.

### 3. Async Pattern Inconsistencies

#### Problem
Mixed async/sync patterns and improper coroutine handling.

```python
# Bad pattern (sync in async context)
async def operation():
    result = sync_operation()  # Blocks event loop
    return result

# Bad pattern (not awaiting coroutines)
async def operation():
    result = async_operation()  # Returns coroutine, not result
    return result[0]  # TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable
```

## Testing Architecture Issues

### 1. Test Isolation Problems

#### Problem
Tests are not properly isolated, leading to flaky test results.

```python
# Tests share global state
class TestUserOperations:
    async def test_create_user(self):
        await db.add(User(name="Alice"))  # Affects other tests
    
    async def test_find_user(self):
        users = await db.find(User.name == "Alice").fetch.all()
        assert len(users) == 1  # May fail if previous test didn't clean up
```

### 2. Driver Compliance Testing Gaps

#### Problem
Each driver is tested differently, allowing inconsistencies to persist.

```python
# Current approach (inconsistent)
class TestSQLiteDriver:
    async def test_specific_feature(self):
        # SQLite-specific test
        pass

class TestMongoDriver:
    async def test_different_feature(self):
        # Different test, not equivalent
        pass
```

#### Solution
Implement parameterized driver compliance testing.

## Performance Architecture Issues

### 1. Connection Pool Inefficiency

#### Problem
Connection pooling is not optimized, leading to resource waste.

```python
# Current pattern (inefficient)
async def operation():
    async with get_connection() as conn:  # Creates new connection each time
        return await conn.execute(query)
```

### 2. Query Performance

#### Problem
Query translation and execution is not optimized.

```python
# Current AST translation (inefficient)
def translate_query(ast_node):
    if isinstance(ast_node, ASTComparisonNode):
        # Recursive translation creates overhead
        left = translate_query(ast_node.left)  # May be expensive
        right = translate_query(ast_node.right)
        return f"{left} {ast_node.operator} {right}"
```

## Resolution Priorities
