# Ommi Project Planning Overview

## Project Status Summary
**Current Version:** 0.2.1  
**Project Phase:** Early Development / Stabilization  
**Test Success Rate:** 40.5% (17/42 tests passing)  
**Priority:** Critical stability improvements needed

## Executive Summary

Ommi is a promising object model mapper with a clear vision and solid architectural foundation. However, the project currently faces critical functionality gaps that prevent it from being production-ready. The main issues center around broken lazy loading, incomplete query APIs, and driver implementation gaps.

## Quick Navigation

### 📋 Planning Documents

2. **Query API Completion** - Essential query operators missing
3. **Result System** - `DBStatusNoResultException` errors throughout

### ⚠️ HIGH (Fix Next)
1. **SQLite Driver Stability** - Primary driver unreliable
2. **Transaction Management** - Isolation and nested transaction issues
3. **Cross-Driver Compatibility** - Ensure consistent behavior

### 📈 MEDIUM (Planned Improvements)
1. **Performance Optimization** - Connection pooling, query caching
2. **Schema Evolution** - Migration system
3. **Advanced Query Features** - Subqueries, aggregations

### 📚 LOW (Future Enhancements)
1. **Additional Drivers** - Redis, DynamoDB, ClickHouse
2. **Enterprise Features** - Multi-tenancy, audit logging
3. **Developer Tools** - CLI tools, IDE plugins

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Phase 1 (Critical Fixes):** 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Stabilization):** 3-4 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Quality):** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Features):** 4-6 weeks
- **Total to 1.0.0:** 3-6 months

### Technical Skills Needed
- **Python AsyncIO** - Core async/await patterns

- [ ] Complete query API implementation
- [ ] SQLite driver stabilized
- [ ] >80% test pass rate achieved

### Medium Term (3-4 months)
- [ ] All drivers feature-complete
- [ ] >90% test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Production-ready documentation

### Long Term (6+ months)
- [ ] 1.0.0 stable release
- [ ] Community adoption growing
- [ ] Framework integrations available
- [ ] Plugin ecosystem developing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Architecture Complexity:** Multi-driver support increases complexity
- **Performance:** Abstraction layer may impact performance
- **Compatibility:** Maintaining compatibility across model libraries

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development:** Fix one driver first, extend patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Driver compliance testing ensures consistency
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous benchmarking prevents regressions

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Strict feature freeze after core functionality
- **Resource Constraints:** Focus on critical path items first
- **External Dependencies:** Database driver updates may impact compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- **Stability:** >95% test pass rate across all drivers
- **Performance:** Within 10% of native driver performance
- **Reliability:** <5 critical bugs in production

### Adoption Metrics
- **Documentation:** >90% API coverage, positive user feedback
- **Community:** Active contributors, growing user base
- **Integration:** Framework integrations available

### Business Metrics
- **Time to Market:** Stable release within 6 months
- **User Experience:** <15 minute onboarding time
- **Support Load:** Reduced basic questions due to better docs

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Review Planning Documents** - Stakeholder alignment on priorities
2. **Set Up Development Environment** - Ensure reproducible dev setup
3. **Begin Critical Fixes** - Start with lazy loading implementation

### Near Term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
