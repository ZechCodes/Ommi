# Issue Dependencies and Fix Priorities

## Dependency Analysis

Understanding the relationships between issues is crucial for determining the optimal fix order. Some issues block others, while some can be addressed in parallel.

## Critical Path Analysis

### 1. Primary Critical Path
```
Result System Issues → Lazy Loading Failure → Query API → SQLite Driver → Cross-Driver
```

**Reasoning:** 
- Lazy loading depends on proper result wrapping
- Query API testing requires working lazy loading
- Driver stability needs complete query API
- Other drivers need stable SQLite as reference

### 2. Secondary Critical Path
```
Type System Problems → Model Registration → Lazy Loading Failure
```

**Reasoning:**
- Model registration fails with type errors
- Lazy loading requires properly registered models
- Both are needed for basic functionality

## Detailed Dependency Analysis

### 1. Lazy Loading Failure Dependencies

#### Blocks:
- **Query API Completion** - Can't test query operators without working relationships
- **Driver Compliance Testing** - Relationship tests are core part of driver validation
- **User Experience** - Core ORM feature non-functional

#### Depends On:
- **Result System Fixes** - Lazy loading needs consistent result wrapping
- **Basic Type System** - Model registration must work for relationship setup

#### Parallel Development:
- **SQLite syntax fixes** - Can be developed alongside lazy loading fixes
- **Documentation updates** - Can document expected behavior

### 2. Query API Incomplete Dependencies

#### Blocks:
- **Advanced User Queries** - Users can't express complex filtering
- **Driver Feature Parity** - All drivers need to support same operators
- **Performance Testing** - Can't benchmark without complete query support

#### Depends On:
- **Lazy Loading Working** - Need relationships to test complex queries
- **Basic Driver Stability** - Need reliable query execution

#### Parallel Development:
- **Operator implementation** - Can add operators independently
- **Driver translation** - Each driver can implement translation separately

### 3. SQLite Driver Issues Dependencies

#### Blocks:
- **Reliable Testing** - Primary testing driver must be stable
- **Other Driver Development** - SQLite serves as reference implementation
- **Performance Benchmarking** - Need stable baseline for comparisons

#### Depends On:
- **Query API** - Need complete query support to test all features
- **Result System** - Need consistent result handling

#### Parallel Development:
- **Reserved keyword fixes** - Independent of other issues
- **Transaction improvements** - Can be developed separately

### 4. Type System Problems Dependencies

#### Blocks:
- **Modern Python Support** - Framework looks outdated with type issues
- **Model Registration** - Complex models fail to register
- **Schema Generation** - Can't create tables for complex types

#### Depends On:
- **Nothing** - Type system issues are foundational

#### Parallel Development:
- **All other fixes** - Type system can be improved independently

## Risk Mitigation for Dependencies

### Risk: Circular Dependencies
**Mitigation:**
- Break circular dependencies with interfaces
- Use dependency injection where needed
- Implement features incrementally

### Risk: Sequential Bottlenecks
**Mitigation:**
- Identify work that can be parallelized
- Prepare comprehensive test suites in advance
- Have rollback plans for each phase

### Risk: Integration Failures
**Mitigation:**
- Continuous integration testing
- Daily integration builds
- Feature flags for new functionality
