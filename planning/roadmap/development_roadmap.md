  - Implement MongoDB-specific query operators
  - Add aggregation pipeline support

- [ ] **Document relationship handling**
  - Embedded document relationships
  - Reference-based relationships
  - Cross-collection joins

## Phase 3: Quality & Performance (2-3 weeks)
**Goal:** Production-ready quality and performance  
**Success Criteria:** Comprehensive testing, performance benchmarks

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Expand test coverage**
  - Achieve >95% code coverage
  - Add integration tests for all drivers
  - Add performance regression tests
  - Cross-driver compatibility tests

- [ ] **Code quality improvements**
  - Add type hints throughout codebase
  - Implement linting/formatting standards
  - Add static analysis tools
  - Documentation coverage

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Query optimization**
  - Connection pooling
  - Query caching mechanisms
  - Batch operation optimizations
  - Lazy loading performance

- [ ] **Memory management**
  - Object lifecycle management
  - Connection resource cleanup
  - Memory leak detection and fixes

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
**Goal:** Feature completeness for 1.0.0 release  
**Success Criteria:** All planned features implemented

### Schema Evolution
- [ ] **Migration system**
  - Database schema versioning
  - Automatic migration generation
  - Safe schema evolution strategies
  - Rollback capabilities

### Advanced Query Features
- [ ] **Complex query support**
  - Subqueries
  - Window functions (SQL databases)
  - Advanced aggregations
  - Cross-model joins

### Additional Database Support
- [ ] **New driver implementations**
  - Redis driver (key-value store)
  - DynamoDB driver (AWS)
  - ClickHouse driver (analytics)

## Post-1.0.0: Future Enhancements

### Community & Ecosystem
- [ ] Plugin system for custom drivers
- [ ] Community driver certification program
- [ ] Integration with popular frameworks (FastAPI, Django, etc.)

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Compliance features (GDPR, HIPAA)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] CLI tools for schema management
- [ ] IDE plugins and integrations
- [ ] Visual query builder
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Driver complexity:** Start with SQLite, extend patterns to other drivers
- **Performance regressions:** Continuous benchmarking
- **API compatibility:** Semantic versioning, deprecation warnings

### Timeline Risks  
- **Scope creep:** Strict feature freeze after Phase 3
- **Resource constraints:** Prioritize critical path items
- **Testing overhead:** Parallel test development with features
