"""
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Implementation for Ommi Query System

This module provides a set of classes for constructing and managing an abstract
syntax tree (AST) for query operations within the Ommi framework. The classes
defined here allow for the creation of logical operators (`ASTLogicalOperatorNode`),
comparison operators (`ASTOperatorNode`), and nodes representing model fields
(`ASTReferenceNode`) or literal values (`ASTLiteralNode`). These are combined into
comparison expressions (`ASTComparisonNode`) and grouped within `ASTGroupNode`
instances to form complex, structured queries.

The AST is the core representation of a query before it is translated by a
database driver into a native database query language (e.g., SQL).

Key components:
-   `ASTNode`: Base class for all AST nodes.
-   `ASTLogicalOperatorNode`: Enum for AND/OR logical operators.
-   `ASTOperatorNode`: Enum for comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, etc.).
-   `ASTGroupFlagNode`: Enum for marking the start and end of groups when iterating.
-   `ASTGroupNode`: Represents a group of comparisons, potentially nested.
    This is the main builder for queries, with methods like `And()`, `Or()`, `limit()`, `sort()`.
-   `ASTComparableNode`: Base class for nodes that can be part of a comparison (references and literals).
-   `ASTReferenceNode`: Represents a reference to a model field (e.g., `User.name`).
-   `ASTLiteralNode`: Represents a literal value in a comparison (e.g., "Alice", 18).
-   `ASTComparisonNode`: Represents a single comparison (e.g., `User.name == "Alice"`).
-   `when()`: A factory function to start building an `ASTGroupNode` from initial comparisons.

Usage typically starts with `when()` or by using comparison operators directly on
model field descriptors (which are instances of `ASTReferenceNode` under the hood via `QueryField`).

Example:
    ```python
    from ommi.query_ast import when
    from my_app.models import User # Assuming User is an @ommi_model

    # Simple query: User.name == "Alice"
    query1 = when(User.name == "Alice")

    # Complex query: (User.age > 18 AND User.is_active == True) OR User.name == "Admin"
    query2 = when((User.age > 18).And(User.is_active == True)).Or(User.name == "Admin")

    # Query with sorting and limit
    query3 = when(User.is_active == True).sort(User.name.asc).limit(10)
    ```
